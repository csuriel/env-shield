# Security Policy

## Privacy and Security Information

Env Shield is designed with your privacy and security in mind:

- **100% Local Processing**: All features work completely locally on your machine. The extension does not communicate with any external servers.
- **No Data Collection**: Your sensitive data remains private - we don't collect, transmit, or store any of your information.
- **Open Source**: The entire codebase is open source and available for review on GitHub at https://github.com/csuriel/env-shield.git
- **Transparent**: The extension simply applies a visual blur effect to sensitive values in your editor - it doesn't modify or access your files in any way.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security-related issues, please report them by:
1. Opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/csuriel/env-shield)

We take all security concerns seriously and will respond as quickly as possible.
